# Gr 12 tutorial page
 A tutorial page for GR12 Mathematics

This project is really close to my heart, takes me back to high school where I have spent six months of my grade 10 without a math teacher, and even in grade 12 I spent a month without a math teacher, and realised later in Varsity the impact of not having a strong foundation in math affected me, so this project is specifically designed for a student possibly facing the same problems that I did to not go through what I did, to just immense himself in the content and build a solid foundation for himself with or without the presence. Because Mathematics is all about build up, and when you have a shaky foundation, the structure will also not be so rigid.

I hope you enjoy this Math Journey!! LOVE AND LIGHT.
